## Scenic baseline models
This directory contains several baseline vision models implemented in Scenic.
These models span a range of architectures, as well as tasks.

They include:

 * Vision Transformer (ViT; https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11929) for image
  classification.
 * MLP-Mixer (https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.01601) an all-MLP model for image
  classification.
 * Residual Networks (ResNet; https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385) and Big Transfer
  ResNet (BitResNet; https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.11370) for image classification.
 * UNet (http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04597) for semantic segmentation.
 * Axial-ResNet (https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.07853) for image classification.
